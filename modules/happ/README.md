# happ-nixos

> Run the [Happ](https://github.com/Happ-proxy/happ-desktop) proxy client on NixOS — packaged properly, with a working HWID.

Happ ships as a prebuilt Debian package that assumes a regular FHS layout and a
writable `/opt/happ` — neither of which exists on NixOS. This module repackages it
for the Nix store and wires up everything needed to run it cleanly, including the
**HWID fix** the plain `.deb` can't manage on a modern NixOS.

## Features

- 📦 **Nix-native packaging** — autoPatchelf + Qt wrapping, no FHS hacks
- 🔑 **Working HWID** — restores the device id dbus-broker leaves empty
- 🛡️ **TUN-mode ready** — firewall, `tun` module, and a root control daemon
- ⚡ **Fast rebuilds** — `/opt/happ` is refreshed only when the package changes

## Installation

Clone into `/etc/nixos`:

```bash
cd /etc/nixos
sudo git clone https://github.com/MrShitFox/happ-nixos
```

Import the module and enable it in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  imports = [ ./happ-nixos/happ-module.nix ];

  services.happ.enable = true;
}
```

Rebuild, then launch **Happ** from your app menu (or run `happ`):

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `services.happ.enable` | `false` | Enable the Happ client and the `happd` daemon. |
| `services.happ.package` | built from `happ.nix` | Override the Happ package. |
| `services.happ.tunInterface` | `"tun0"` | TUN device trusted by the firewall. |

## The HWID fix

Happ derives its hardware id from Qt's `machineUniqueId()`, which on Linux reads
`/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`. NixOS defaults to **dbus-broker**, and — unlike the
classic dbus-daemon — it doesn't create that file, so the id comes back empty and
the client shows a blank HWID. The module links it to the real machine id:

```nix
systemd.tmpfiles.rules = [ "L+ /var/lib/dbus/machine-id - - - - /etc/machine-id" ];
```

## Updating

```bash
cd /etc/nixos/happ-nixos && sudo git pull
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

## Notes

- Protocols: VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks over TUN. Hysteria2 is not supported.
- Happ is a closed-source but freely redistributable binary; the package leaves its
  license unset, so `allowUnfree` is not required.
- Unofficial community module — not affiliated with the Happ project.
